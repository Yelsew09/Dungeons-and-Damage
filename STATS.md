Character ideas:
    Cleric/healer - I could see this working, but in a doubles format which I will not be coding any time soon
    Druid - Taking a turn to turn into a different form with wildly different stats
    
Gameplay ideas:
    items, every charcter has unique items
    SPDBON everyturn the next player increases that much P2SPD = P2SPD + P2SPDBON
possible titles for the game?
    not really a name guy, do you got any ideas -
