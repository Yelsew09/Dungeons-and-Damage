# Dungeons & Damage
<p>This is an experimental rpg that will get updated as time goes on</p>
<p>It's meant to be a space to put things we've learned to the test as we learn more things in Python</p>
<p>As of this release, I don't really have an idea as to where I should go from here. I don't want to add visuals, as the terminal is much more unique</p>
<p>Also, it's kinda just Excalibur on this right now. Emilio isn't in Python 2 and went to go take game design. I hope he comes back with the ability to make this game better.</p>
<p>It started as a fun little thing and as of now is evolving</p>

## Characters
<p>You can play as:</p>

### Knight
<p>A man who fought valiantly and for honor for his kingdom. Now, he’s been captured and put to fight in the arena. If he wins, he will be allowed to leave.</p>

### Peashooter
<p>No one knows how he came to be. He’s a plant that shoots peas out of his mouth. Some say he was made by a witch, others, god. No one knows, not even him</p>

### Mage
<p>A traveling mage who claims to have mastered magic as a whole. People were skeptical, so he decided to go to the gladiator fight and prove that he is a master of all things arcane</p>

### Rouge
<p>The rouge was caught stealing from the King. Because of this, the King sent the rouge to fight in the gladiator fight, one that he would be attending personally. If the rouge put on a good show, he and his family would get rewarded handsomely (only the family if he dies), and if he doesn’t, he will be executed</p>

### Skele
<p>One day, a pile of bones in a prisoner cell became animated. The people in charge of the prison saw this and thought, “Hey! Why don’t we just send him into the arena if he can’t die?”</p>

### Bard
<p>The bard is a barkeep at the local bar. He serves drinks, he plays songs, and he gets to know the regulars. One day, he made a bet with someone where the loser would go fight in the arena. Needless to say, he lost the bet</p>

### Barbarian
<p>The barbarian has no identity, so we can’t really give him a proper story, but he kinda just broke in to the arena for the thrill of the fight</p>

## Plans
<p>I want to add a new gun interaction, where if you missed your shot, the narrator will remember that and laugh whenever the next gun comes into play</p>
<p>Abilites for each character are in the works, and right now each fighter has a very simple passive ability that won't determine the outcome of the match</p>
<p>A computer. Idk how this would work, and it would probably be a lot of if statements and easily exploitable.</p>
<p>More magic options maybe?</p>
<p>More than 2 players. I think this would be cool. Maybe a 4-player FFA</p>
<p>Or maybe a 2v2 mode where you can cast benificial spells for allies</p>
<p>I like how this is becoming closer to Pokemon with every update</p>
